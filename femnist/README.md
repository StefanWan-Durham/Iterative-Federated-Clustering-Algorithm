# IFCA - CIFAR10

Implementation of IFCA, experiments with FEMNIST.
Most of the codes are based on Leaf FedAvg implementation (link)


## Requirements
* Python3
* Tensorflow 1.15
* Numpy

## Running the experiments

### To reproduce results in the paper:
```bash
bash run_all.sh
```

## Notes
*
* GPU is used.

## TODO
- Cleanup
- Merge ifca/local/oneshot experiment code into one codebase
